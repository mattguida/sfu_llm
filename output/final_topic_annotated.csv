7874382,Will we respond to Sudan's own hell?,"It's a good thing militant Islamists have a knack for spin. When al-Qaeda-linked insurgents declared that France had 'opened the gates of hell' with its assault in Mali, it offered up a headline opportunity to news media around the world.Any attention paid to this part of Africa brings a whimper of hope for those living where the gates of hell have been swinging wide open for some time: the borderland in Sudan. It's 3,000 kilometres from Mali, where international troops are currently focused - a man-made famine zone where Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has been orchestrating a humanitarian catastrophe that has affected more than 800,000 people.In September, Canadian writers Gerald Caplan and Amanda Grzyb wrote in The Globe and Mail about the efforts of 66 genocide scholars (including themselves) from 10 countries to demand help for the people suffering in the state of Blue Nile and the Nuba Mountains region of South Kordofan, which border newly independent South Sudan. 'We can clearly see the tragic cost of the world's collective inaction,' they wrote, detailing the famine and state-sponsored violence against civilians there.Efforts to enact the Responsibility to Protect, the United Nations doctrine that says humanity has a duty to defend innocent civilians, is mired in the mysteries of why governments choose the locations they do and why our appetite for such stories is eclipsed by entertainment and ease. Where is a caring God when you need one? I suppose the answer is readily available in something quite germane to our Canadian psyche.Since June, 2011, Mr. al-Bashir has effectively banned all international humanitarian access to these areas. Many Canadian charities are doing their work off the record in order to safeguard their access.The charity workers we do know about are the kind of Canadians we admire. For example, there is 29-year-old Anne Amirthanayagam of Toronto. She was doing customer data research when she felt a nagging need for something different. By Skype, I caught up with her this week at the Yida refugee camp on the South Sudanese side of the border, where she works as a logistics co-ordinator for Samaritan's Purse Canada.'Many children have passed away because of malnutrition,' she told me, noting the 1,200 new registrants in her camp of 65,000, which is about 20 kilometres from the war zone. 'There was a lot of aerial bombardment in December. People come as they can get out. Most have very young children and are pretty malnourished.'Canadian donors to Samaritan's Purse are paying for the camp's water and sanitation needs. Ms. Amirthanayagam also manages World Food Program logistics for the delivery of food, which is limited to sorgum, oil, salt and lentils. 'It's pretty basic - vegetables are rare,' she said. There are still no schools, but refugees have created mosques and churches.It was Christ's call that drew Ms. Amirthanayagam to Yida, she said, but she's discovering something indomitable in the people there.'Nubian people are a pretty amazing group. They are hard workers, they have a strong entrepreneurial spirit about them, and I see a lot of joy in them. If this was North America, I don't think we'd be reacting to the challenges like they have.'Oh, that the people of this camp and the thousands trapped in Sudan could one day soon say the same about us and how we responded to the news of their plight.Lorna Dueck is host of Context TV, seen Sundays on Global and Vision TV.","'a man-made famine zone where Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has been orchestrating a humanitarian catastrophe that has affected more than 800, 000 people.'HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE800, 000 people means nothing to leftist pacifiststheir pacifism is ABSOLUTE and supremeit trumps even genocide",Progressive111,8cda8044c1e64a769b6091bb297c6d77,Humanitarian Crisis in Sudan,Humanitarian Crises
10352910,Rob Ford's personal foibles may overwhelm his Toronto mayorship,"To his critics, Rob Ford has been something of a hundred-year storm, his mayoralty marked by steep budget cuts and sharp policy reversals.But to a far greater degree, Mr. Ford's career may end up being defined not so much by his policies as by his comportment - and by whatever impulses that have produced a string of unnecessary scandals marked by a tendency to take risks that many politicians would consider unthinkable.Reports that Mr. Ford was asked to leave a gala event seem to be the latest in a string of incidents that could raise questions about his judgment.His office is strenuously denying the allegations. Scarborough councillor Paul Ainslie confirms that he's urged Mr. Ford to leave the event, but others say they haven't observed the alleged behaviour: 'I've never seen him drunk at work or even drinking at work,' says Peter Milczyn, an Etobicoke councilor.Mr. Ford has found himself in similar binds before. Over the years, he has been caught out in a range of embarrassing situations, ranging from an outburst at a Maple Leaf hockey game to incidents involving his car. He's given the finger to drivers who took issue with his cell phone use, and was photographed reading while driving on a highway.Far more revealing, however, has been his response to such incidents. Mr. Ford will typically deny or dismiss accusations. But privately, he has resisted repeated and often well-intentioned attempts by his closest advisors, handlers and allies to change the way he reacts to these allegations and deals with the issues they generate. He does not `handle,' in the parlance of politics.He has repeatedly declined to take any remedial action to avoid such criticism. For example, he refused to hire a driver, despite calls from the chief of police that such clearly dangerous habits imperil not just himself but other citizens. During the long-running controversy over his involvement with the Ford family's football charity, Mr. Ford refused to distance himself from the foundation as a means of short-circuiting accusations of political conflict of interest.In fact, there have been times when Mr. Ford appears to be acting without any political or bureaucratic advice whatsoever. When he called a radio station over the weekend and expressed his views about the trial of Richard Kachkar - the man accused of killing a Toronto police officer with a stolen snow plough - he almost forced a mistrial. But the more egregious sin was that he seemed not to understand that as a public figure, he shouldn't be weighing in during the middle of a sensitive trial.How does all this connect to his politics? Mr. Ford has always practiced high-wire politics. Before becoming mayor, as Toronto journalist Ed Keenan documented in Some Great Idea, Mr. Ford built a reputation as a likeable retail politician who easily connected with ordinary people and solved his constituents' problems. At the same time, he aggravated many of his council colleagues with personal attacks.The mayoralty amplified the tension between Mr. Ford's best and worst instincts. In his early months as mayor, he preferred to bully centrist members of council to pursue unachievable goals rather than forge pragmatic alliances. Yet this with-us-or-against-us approach backfired badly. Since late 2011, Mr. Ford has been unable to advance his agenda, and the sense of political impotence has served to foreground the personal scandals.It's not clear whether the latest allegations will prompt Mr. Ford to change his ways or hunker down. There was a time when Mr. Ford's foibles humanized him. But Mr. Ford's mayoralty today appears to be trapped in limbo, leaving him politically isolated to a degree rarely seen for public figure in his position.","Ford's charity 'Budget Chief Mike Del Grande is tired of Mayor Rob Ford getting sacked for his football coaching' and ''I wish you would have learned that the mayor pays for some of these kids where they live, buys them groceries,' Del Grande said.

Before reaching any conclusions or assuming anything, we need more evidence.That is why it is so important for the mayor to respond in detail. The city's future, and the future of his mayoralty, are at stake. Calling the story ridiculous is not sufficient. Is he saying the video is a fake? Does he know any of the men involved?These questions will not go away by waving away the whole story with a curt denial. Many city councillors are saying the mayor should make a full statement to clear the air. They are right. This story is racing around the world. The mayor should come forward to his give his own side as promptly as possible.He needs either to put all this behind him and get on with governing, or he needs to get out of the way.

14112165,Who's failing math? The system,"Here's some bad news from the world of education: Math scores are in decline across Canada. Just as kids in Poland and Portugal and other formerly disadvantaged countries are taking great leaps forward, ours are going backward. Our high schools are graduating kids who have failed to grasp the fundamentals, and our universities are full of students who are struggling to master material they should have learned in high school.What's gone wrong isn't a mystery. For the past decade and more, school systems across the country have been performing a vast experiment on your children. They have discarded 'rote' learning in favour of 'discovery,' a process by which students are supposed to come up with their own solutions to the mysteries of arithmetic. There's ample evidence that this approach leaves millions of kids (to say nothing of their parents) baffled and confused, and it is being abandoned in large parts of the United States. This has not deterred legions of Canadian education theorists and consultants from pressing on. Perhaps they're secretly in league with Kumon and Sylvan to drum up business.Ontario Education Minister Liz Sandals thinks she knows why scores are slipping. Most elementary school teachers have backgrounds in the liberal arts. Their acquaintance with math is sketchy at best. (Ms. Sandals, no slouch with numbers, has a masters degree in math.) And teachers' college doesn't give them enough grounding. 'We need to deal with math so that the teachers have the same comfort level with teaching math that they do with reading and writing,' she said last week.Actually, the problem is much deeper than that. The teachers may be clueless, but the methods they're supposed to use are bound to fail. The curriculum has downgraded arithmetic to near-invisibility. The 'progressive' approach to instruction guarantees that many students will not master basic skills, will not understand fractions, will not learn to multiply or divide two-digit numbers on their own. After all, that's what calculators are for!'Provincial curriculum guides and math textbooks have been systematically expunged of the standard algorithms,' Manitoba teacher Michael Zwaagstra, a leading education critic, told me. An algorithm is simply a rule that tells you how to do stuff. For example, how do you add 2,368 and 9,417? If you learned the standard way, you'll stack the numbers and start adding from the right: 8+7=15, carry the 1 and so on.That may be efficient, but it's hopelessly uncreative. With 'discovery' math, kids are encouraged to reinvent the wheel by, say, starting on the left, adding the thousands, then the hundreds, then the tens and ones, and adding them all up at the end. Then they have to write a story about how they got the answer. Needless to say, this takes a whole lot longer.The trouble is that math is built on fundamentals. If you miss a building block, you're likely to become progressively confused. To make things worse, the current practice of social promotion - moving kids from grade to grade even if they're hopelessly at sea - guarantees that armies of youngsters whose parents can't afford Kumon will be left in the dark. So much for equality in education.For years, math professors at our leading universities have been telling elementary and high-school educators that their methods don't work. But the educators and the teachers' colleges have refused to listen. After all, what do the professors know? They're just math geeks. They have no idea how to teach children. As a consequence, there is now an almost total disconnect between the math that's taught in most schools and the math that students need in university or the real world in order to succeed. It's notable that educators in Eastern Europe and Asia, in particular, are astounded by what they've seen happening in North America.So maybe those sinking test scores are a good thing. The education establishment may be immune to public pressure, but politicians are not. In Manitoba, where math professors and parents have been up in arms, the government has announced a bold new policy - it's bringing back arithmetic! 'Let's face it,' Education Minister Nancy Allan told the Winnipeg Free Press, 'doing math in your head is important.'As for parents who don't live in Manitoba, not all is lost. You can lobby, too. You can look up the Khan Academy on YouTube, which offers very good instructional videos for free. Or there's Kumon and its ilk. Wouldn't it be nice if our schools could put them out of business?",THANK YOU MARGARET WENTEfor opening this can of wormsAll these posts should be required reading at the faculties of educationif public schools were part of the free market it seems the 'customers' would go elsewhere,Progressive111,fa52c5bf4dd54a69b62617dceee3e8cc,Education,Public Education
14168845,Classroom fads and magic beans,"When I was a kid, school was simple. We sat in tidy rows and sounded out 'The cat sat on the mat,' and learned to add 4 and 3. Most of the teachers were kind and good. None had ever heard of critical thinking skills, multiple learning styles, emotional intelligence or collaborative learning. Despite their ignorance, most of us learned to read and write. School was fun, but orderly. It was widely believed that the principal, Mrs. Murphy, had a spanking machine in her office.I would never say that school was better in the good old days. But the classroom hadn't yet been taken over by educational pseudo-science. Today, education systems are in the grip of wave after wave of faddish, mostly unsubstantiated ideas about how children learn and how they should be taught. The champions of these ideas promise that they can teach us how to turn our students into smarter, better, more creative citizens who have the tools to thrive in the 21st century, which will be a century like none the world has ever known.New ideas crash upon the system at regular intervals, engulfing teachers, schools and entire ministries of education in jargon-ridden floods of good intentions, bold initiatives, dubious research and wishful thinking. Good, experienced teachers roll their eyes, pretend to comply and carry on.Now, one teacher has struck back. Tom Bennett's Teacher Proof: Why Research in Education Doesn't Always Mean What it Claims, is a witty, energetic demolition job on what passes for modern pedagogic science. He's British, but the education fads and follies he describes have swept through Canada and the United States as well.Take the theory that there isn't just one kind of intelligence, but many. The originator of this theory was Howard Gardner, who argued that intelligence can be spatial, linguistic, logical-mathematical, kinesthetic and so on. A related idea is that kids have different learning styles, and that teachers should adapt their methods to each style. These theories are widely thought to be grounded in the latest neuroscience. In fact, there is zero science to support them. They are assertions that are essentially untestable - and the evidence that they can make classroom teaching more effective simply does not exist. The same goes for emotional intelligence, an appealing concept arguing that 'emotional competence' is distinct from old-style intelligence and can be modified in the school environment.It's easy to see why these theories are appealing. We'd like to think that every kid is special, with his own strengths. We're also wedded to the notion of egalitarianism - the idea that every child can have an equal shot at success, if only we nurture her talents in the right way. This is what Mr. Bennett calls the 'magic bean' syndrome: 'People want to believe that there are magic ways to solve complex problems,' he says in Teacher Proof.Some of these fads are harmless, but some are not. Mr. Bennett has a special loathing for 'collaborative learning' - the assumption, now deeply entrenched, that everything is done better in groups. He calls it an invitation to misbehaviour, a recipe for disguised inactivity, unequal loading and unfair assessment. He drips with scorn for 'the self-evidently intellectually bereft idea that children learn best from other children' and the equally loony idea that teachers should 'stop telling them things they don't know.'Mr. Bennett isn't arguing that all kids should be treated the same, that they they can never learn from each other or that group work is never useful. He's arguing that there are no magic beans. Armchair experts should stop telling experienced teachers how children learn, and how to teach them how to learn. 'I have some strong opinions about this,' he says. 'I suspect that children learn when they are told stuff, and forced in some way to remember it, and practise it.'Education is rife with advocacy passing as research. Nowhere is this more true than with our contentious, emotional and awesomely expensive foray into all-day kindergarten. Anxious parents who want the best start for their children (as well as free daycare) are all for it, understandably. According to the kindergarten lobby (which includes most provincial ministries of education), depriving our children of full-day kindergarten is tantamount to child abuse.'There is powerful new evidence from neuroscience that the early years of development from conception to age 6, particularly for the first three years, set the base for competence and coping skills that will affect learning, behaviour and health throughout life,' B.C.'s Education Ministry says on its website, quoting research from Ontario. What the website doesn't say is that there's no evidence at all that early childhood education makes any difference to children's long-term outcomes. Sadly, even all-day kindergarten is not a magic bean.'There is definitely a lot of neuro-garbage in the education market,' Daniel Willingham, a University of Virginia psychologist who is an expert on science and education, says on his blog. And there are lots of of vested interests in perpetuating it. A large industry of education consultants, advisers and academics - not to mention publishers and businesses selling everything from seminars and textbooks to interactive smart boards - makes a living off these magic beans. Much of the research claiming that the beans work is remarkably shabby. But, he writes, 'universities are reluctant to blow the whistle on the whole charade because schools of education - second-rate or not - bring tuition dollars.'Please remember this the next time you hear the phrase 'critical thinking skills.' It doesn't really matter what they are or whether your kid has them. What matters is whether she can read and write.","Wente sayseducational pseudo-science. ..wave after wave of faddish, mostly unsubstantiated ideas about how children learn and how they should be taught.

14315072,"Barack Obama, the 98-pound weakling","So, let me get this straight. Some red lines cannot be crossed, and gassing Syrian children is one of them. That's what Barack Obama told us Tuesday evening. 'The images from this massacre are sickening,' he said. 'Men, women, children lying in rows, killed by poison gas, others foaming at the mouth, gasping for breath. A father clutching his dead children, imploring them to get up and walk.'The moral imperative is clear, he argued. We cannot let dictators get away with this. On the other hand, the United States can't be expected to solve all the world's problems, either. Therefore, the way ahead is to outsource U.S. foreign policy on Syria to ... Vladimir Putin!So much for the credibility of the world's only superpower. Mr. Obama's staff have been tweeting that this delaying tactic is an incredible display of smart diplomacy. But to most of us, it just makes him look gullible. The President has allowed himself to be hog-tied and hornswoggled by Lilliputians. He was determined not to repeat the mistakes of the past, when a blundering giant threw its weight around and only wound up showing the world how incompetent it is. But if there's one thing worse than being a blundering giant, it's being a 98-pound weakling.On Thursday, Mr. Putin kicked more sand in his face. On the op-ed page of The New York Times no less, he lectured Mr. Obama on diplomacy and peace. 'From the outset, Russia has advocated peaceful dialogue enabling Syrians to develop a compromise plan for their own future,' he said with a straight face. 'We are not protecting the Syrian government, but international law.'This from the guy who has been arming Bashar al-Assad to the teeth and blocking the United Nations from doing anything about it. Mr. al-Assad has been using Russian weapons to slaughter his own people.I guess it's always possible that the Syrian dictator (memorably likened to a 'human toothbrush' by Christopher Hitchens) will immediately surrender his stockpiles of chemical weapons (which he has claimed he doesn't have), welcome UN weapons inspectors with open arms and give armed protection to the squads of experts who will be necessary to decommission and destroy his various caches of nerve gas, who will somehow do their jobs in the midst of a the bloody civil war that has already destroyed half the country. Or maybe the UN can send in peacekeepers to put it under international control. Or maybe the Easter Bunny will intervene.More likely is that Mr. al-Assad will use the newly opened diplomatic track to obfuscate, delay, prevaricate and continue killing people, while tying up the process in endless procedural knots. He has now promised to sign the UN Chemical Weapons Treaty - just not quite yet, and only if the U.S. stops arming the rebels, and only if Israel ratifies it first.Like most everybody else, I'm confused as hell over Syria. The trouble is, Mr. Obama is confused, too. This is not reassuring. He appears to be making it up as he goes along. The only thing that's clear is that he hates - really hates - being commander-in-chief. He was the guy who was going to get the United States out of all of George W. Bush's messes. And now this!Mr. Bush's problem was that once he made decisions, he never second-guessed himself. Mr. Obama's problem is that he overthinks. He changes his mind and paints himself into a corner. At first, he said Mr. al-Assad had to go. Then he said regime change wasn't in the cards. He said there was a red line Mr. al-Assad mustn't cross. Then, when Mr. al-Assad crossed it, he said it wasn't his red line, it was the world's - even as it became excruciatingly clear that the world wasn't about to do a thing about it.He said Syria poses no threat to America, but also that attacking it would be in the national interest. On his own, he decided to seek Congressional approval - then trapped himself when it turned out Americans had no taste for another foreign (mis)adventure of the kind he had promised to extricate them from.No wonder seasoned foreign-policy types are tearing their hair out in clumps. 'Words like ad hoc and improvised and unsteady come to mind,' Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, told the Times.I've always been deeply skeptical of the case for intervening, for the simple reason that it might wind up doing more harm than good. The two strongest reasons, it seems to me, were to show that there are consequences for violating international norms, and to demonstrate that the United States means what it says.But Mr. Obama doesn't really mean what he says. So why should anybody take him seriously? In fact, there are no consequences, and everything he and his comically inept sidekick John Kerry have said about human rights and justice and the 'moral obscenity' of chemical weapons is just a bunch of hot air. His message to rogue states like Iran is: You can get away with anything. His message to greater powers such as China is that he's incapable of strategic thinking.

Some nurses will have to ditch their head coverings; others won't.The charter's supporters are a weird amalgam of intellectual, leftist baby boomers (Ms. Marois, Jean-Francois Lisee) and small-town cultural conservatives. It's as if Margaret Atwood and John Ralston Saul decided to bed down with Myron Thompson.The people who devised the charter are strongly feminist. They claim that women should have choice, except when it comes to head coverings, when they should not. (Interestingly, the charter is largely opposed by Quebeckers who actually live and work with minorities - and supported by those who don't.)Ms. Marois promised that the charter would unite Quebeckers. Instead, it's proved bitterly divisive. And for what? The chance that it will ever become law is small. And the chance that people will forget about the economy is remote. A new poll conducted for L'Actualite found that Quebeckers ranked adoption of a values charter next to last of 11 priorities for their government.Nonetheless, the Rest of Canada shouldn't be too smug. In case you think that the RoC is more enlightened than those intolerant Quebeckers, take a look at any English-language publication's online comments, including The Globe's. If social media are any indication, the unease over multiculturalism is deep-seated and widespread. Which means that somebody, some time, will try to exploit it.","years of political correctness have made canada into ""HOTEL CANADA""just a place to stayimmigrate put the kids in high school - freebring the old parents here - free medicarethen return to the home country and make more money, lower tax rates there toomeanwhile the family is in canada getting all these social benefitsthen later come back to canada and die - free hospitalso bienvenu to HOTEL CANADAthe term Hotel Canada comes from canadian author Yann Martel",Progressive111,677817_0,Multiculturalism in Quebec,Illegal Immigration

It is designed politically to rally so-called pure laine francophone voters around the PQ, because too many of them turned off the party and away from Quebec secession, the party's reason for being.With secession a non-starter and the government stumbling on many files, the PQ's popularity had sunk so low that it had little chance of re-election. Enter the values charter and its prohibition against most religious symbols worn by public employees.Since the share of Quebec public employees who are not francophones is far below their share of the province's overall population, the issue of wearing symbols was more existential than real. In the real world, as opposed to the abstract world of imagination, these religious symbols figured not at all throughout most of Quebec, and only marginally in and around Montreal.But 'wedge issues' are usually about 'them against us,' and in this case, the PQ hopes that the 'us' is francophones and their fear of the 'other,' especially in vast swaths of the province where representatives of the 'other' are seldom in evidence. The wedge was in the mind, rather than in reality.What the charter has accomplished is a rare feat: an amazing coalition of people and institutions of prominence who are against the idea. Every provincial party in Quebec, except the PQ, has opposed the idea - to say nothing of the three federal parties. The vast majority of constitutional experts in Quebec and beyond say it is unconstitutional.

Lisette Lapointe, a former MLA and wife of former premier Jacques Parizeau, the PQ's Great Thunderer, said she couldn't abide the charter. Even some secessionists have denounced it.At least in the very short term, the charter has accomplished what the PQ hoped: an increase in the party's share of the popular vote, according to an online survey (beware these!) by Leger Marketing. However, that same survey showed that overall support for the charter has fallen from 57 per cent in August, when it was the subject of stories based on leaks, to 43 per cent today, now that the proposed text is known and the fusillade of opposition has begun. What this poll does not show is where the charter ranks on a list of priorities of ordinary voters.Without substantial changes, the charter has no chance of being approved by the National Assembly, where the PQ has only a thin majority of seats and three parties ranged against it. The PQ is obviously hoping that the charter will coalesce just enough francophone voters to allow it to eke out a majority victory should the PQ decide to use the charter as a launching pad for the next election.The trouble is that the issue has nothing to do with the day-to-day concerns of ordinary Quebeckers, namely the economy and social programs. The charter is a diversion, deliberately chosen by a government in political trouble. There had been isolated instances of religious symbols causing kerfuffles, but nothing of ongoing systemic concern to merit this kind of attention and non-solution to a non-problem.Those kerfuffles, however, did cause the previous Liberal government to appoint the Bouchard-Taylor commission on 'reasonable accommodation.'

I came to the park, but saw no signs of Ford life. It turns out that Centennial Park is roughly the size of Belgium - a huge swath of baseball diamonds, sports fields and golf links - and I was on the wrong side.Like a downtowner, I looked for a cab. Ha! I called a cab, but the taxi guy needed an address and I was on a grassy verge in the middle of - who knows where? The dispatcher referred me to a Mississauga cab company, which referred me back to a Toronto company. I started walking over acres of newly mown grass. From behind a ski hill I heard distant strains of music. What was that they were playing? I made out Moves Like Jagger. Ah, Ford Fest.This Fest, the first in Etobicoke held outside the Fords' backyard, is the best-organized yet. I pass a line of 20 or so Ur-in-Luck (get it?) portable toilets. I come to the lineup for burgers and corn. The orderly queue stretches about 200 metres. There is a separate lineup for the beer tent and another for photos with Mayor Rob Ford, who waits like the girl in the kisses-for-cash booth at a country fair. As folks stop to praise him, he smiles shyly, shuffles his feet and, Elvis-like, mutters, 'thank you, thank you very much.'It is hard to tell how many people have come because they love Mr. Ford and how many because they love corn and beer, but the hard core of Ford Nation are here in good numbers. Jackie Baisden, 56, a nurse, says she is 'celebrating the togetherness and love he shows us. He's a people person. Just like he finds time for us, we find time for him.'Her grandson Nicholas McComie, 10, says he plays soccer on an Etobicoke team and the mayor has come to see them. 'I like him because he'll make us laugh and say funny things,' says Nicholas. 'He makes good decisions and he's a very nice person.'Behind the food line, kids tear up and down the ski hill as night falls and the bright field lights come on. A guy who makes balloon animals has a balloon array on his head that says 'Ford.' All over, people wear Ford Fest Rocks T-shirts or wave Ford flags. At the music tent, singer Jenny James hands out the lyrics to her tune Mayor Ford (The World Will Remember), which she debuted at the previous Ford Fest, in Scarborough earlier this summer. The immortal words include, 'We've seen tax-and-spend heroes before, their fancy speeches, oh what a bore.' No one seems bored tonight.If politics is bread and circuses, the Fords know how to deliver. After an hour or so posing for pix, the mayor takes the stage. Camera phones flash. Kids are hoisted on shoulders. Cheers break out as Mr. Ford promises to 'keep taxes low and put more money in your pockets.'He tells his followers, 'Words can't describe what this means. This is truly a reflection of Ford Nation.' As he leaves the stage, his brother Doug yells, 'God bless Ford Nation.'

14450333,Do you know the way to Ford Fest?,"Okay, so I got lost on the way to Ford Fest.The announcements said it was being held in Centennial Park so I took the Eglinton West 32A bus to the end of the line and started walking. I came to the park, but saw no signs of Ford life. It turns out that Centennial Park is roughly the size of Belgium - a huge swath of baseball diamonds, sports fields and golf links - and I was on the wrong side.Like a downtowner, I looked for a cab. Ha! I called a cab, but the taxi guy needed an address and I was on a grassy verge in the middle of - who knows where? The dispatcher referred me to a Mississauga cab company, which referred me back to a Toronto company. I started walking over acres of newly mown grass. From behind a ski hill I heard distant strains of music. What was that they were playing? I made out Moves Like Jagger. Ah, Ford Fest.This Fest, the first in Etobicoke held outside the Fords' backyard, is the best-organized yet. I pass a line of 20 or so Ur-in-Luck (get it?) portable toilets. I come to the lineup for burgers and corn. The orderly queue stretches about 200 metres. There is a separate lineup for the beer tent and another for photos with Mayor Rob Ford, who waits like the girl in the kisses-for-cash booth at a country fair. As folks stop to praise him, he smiles shyly, shuffles his feet and, Elvis-like, mutters, 'thank you, thank you very much.'It is hard to tell how many people have come because they love Mr. Ford and how many because they love corn and beer, but the hard core of Ford Nation are here in good numbers. Jackie Baisden, 56, a nurse, says she is 'celebrating the togetherness and love he shows us. He's a people person. Just like he finds time for us, we find time for him.'Her grandson Nicholas McComie, 10, says he plays soccer on an Etobicoke team and the mayor has come to see them. 'I like him because he'll make us laugh and say funny things,' says Nicholas. 'He makes good decisions and he's a very nice person.'Behind the food line, kids tear up and down the ski hill as night falls and the bright field lights come on. A guy who makes balloon animals has a balloon array on his head that says 'Ford.' All over, people wear Ford Fest Rocks T-shirts or wave Ford flags. At the music tent, singer Jenny James hands out the lyrics to her tune Mayor Ford (The World Will Remember), which she debuted at the previous Ford Fest, in Scarborough earlier this summer. The immortal words include, 'We've seen tax-and-spend heroes before, their fancy speeches, oh what a bore.' No one seems bored tonight.If politics is bread and circuses, the Fords know how to deliver. After an hour or so posing for pix, the mayor takes the stage. Camera phones flash. Kids are hoisted on shoulders. Cheers break out as Mr. Ford promises to 'keep taxes low and put more money in your pockets.'He tells his followers, 'Words can't describe what this means. This is truly a reflection of Ford Nation.' As he leaves the stage, his brother Doug yells, 'God bless Ford Nation.'

14692783,Enough labouring over the nation's wombs,"Facing stalled economies and less-than-optimistic political futures, leaders of many countries have been lashing out at the wombs of millions of women. Impotently unable to control their economies, they are desperately trying to nudge up their labour forces demographically.Listen, for example, to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He has devoted much of this year, when he has had much else on his plate, to a pointless campaign to populate his country's wombs.'Come, please donate to this nation at least three children,' he told party supporters in August. Earlier this year, he explained the logic behind this demand: 'One or two children mean bankruptcy. Three children mean we are not improving but not receding either. So, I repeat, at least three children are necessary in each family, because our population risks aging.'And this week, he amplified it: 'Three children are not enough,' he told women: 'Have four.'This is a moment when Turkey, along with many other Middle Eastern countries, should be celebrating the end of out-of-control population growth. Turkey's fertility rate has dropped to a non-growth 2.06 children per woman, the same as France. It already has 74 million people. This should be celebrated.As the United Nations Population Fund concluded last year, Turkey's working-age population - which will peak in 2040 even as the total population shrinks - is a 'demographic window of opportunity,' as long as focus is placed on the employment of young people, particularly women (who are woefully underemployed in Turkey), rather than on turning them into baby factories.Instead, Mr. Erdogan, like too many of his fellow leaders, has panicked.Sadly, he is not alone in this fallopian fallacy. Iran's fertility rate has plunged from a terrifying seven children per family in the 1980s to 1.64 today - the same rate as Canada - as a result of urbanization and the education of women. But in response, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad spent his entire eight-year presidency badgering Iranian women to get knocked up more frequently, often on spiritual grounds.It didn't work; nor will Mr. Erdogan's campaign. But these fertility panics can have devastating effects.Look at China. The world's most populous country's obsession with birth rates has caused immeasurable damage since 1979, when the so-called One-Child Policy was born.The policy's name is misleading: Chinese have, on average, between 1.2 and 1.8 children, depending on how you measure, which means there are probably as many families with two children as there are with one. In villages, where the policy isn't as strictly enforced, two children is almost universal. In cities, among those who can pay for the privilege, you'll find a good number of families with three or more. That's revealing: The one-child policy was never really necessary as a population-control measure - urbanization and education achieved that effect much more efficiently. Instead, it serves almost entirely as a revenue source, a tax on motherhood.Lawyer Wu Youshui recently discovered, through diligent research, that 19 of China's 34 provincial governments together collected $2.7-billion in fines last year from parents who ran afoul of the one-child law. Those fines are negligible for wealthy families, and punitive for farmers. The result is awful: 'Village family-planning officers vigilantly chart the menstrual cycle and pelvic-exam results of every woman of childbearing age in their area,' Chinese essayist Ma Jian wrote recently. If unacceptably pregnant, they face forced abortions - or they pay a fine worth a couple of years' earnings.Now, there is a serious movement afoot among senior Chinese officials and academics to change the law - unfortunately, by making it into a two-child policy, which would likely be just as punitive and revenue-rich as 'one' child. A report published in August by Bank of America economists projected that this would produce 9.5 million more babies per year - an insignificant stopgap for China's labour force.The reason for this movement is that last year was the first in decades when China's working-age population shrank. Meanwhile, the pension-dependent population grew dramatically - a situation many other countries are now facing, as well.That does pose economic challenges. But real solutions involve education, social safety nets and expanded productivity. The short-sighted political solution is to push for more workers, by cajoling them into the nation's wombs.It won't work, but it will make plenty of women's lives miserable.",Wombswhat is Doug Sanders problem? didn't mother nature design wombs to have children?,Progressive111,fdbf6a657e464d819359fefb42b6a646,Population Growth,Transgender Issues
